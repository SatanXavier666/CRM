# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Your micro.so website clone is ready to deploy! Follow these simple steps:

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Open this link in your browser:**
   ```
   https://github.com/SatanXavier666/CRM/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Build and deployment" section:**
   - Find the **"Source"** dropdown
   - Select: **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - That's it! No need to click Save - it saves automatically

## Step 2: Trigger the Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow is already set up. After enabling Pages:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SatanXavier666/CRM/actions
2. Click on "Deploy static content to Pages" workflow
3. Click the "Run workflow" button
4. Select branch: **main**
5. Click the green "Run workflow" button

## Step 3: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

You'll see a yellow dot ðŸŸ¡ while it's deploying, then a green checkmark âœ… when done.

## Step 4: View Your Live Website! ðŸŽ‰

Once deployed, your website will be live at:

```
